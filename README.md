# TLSproject
Basic SMTP-TLS server/client over TCP

The included cert.pem file is bogus and was made for the purposes of the project. It is used by both the client and server, so simplify things. Normally this would be a terrible idea to ensure security.

Also, the line that specifies the certfile MUST be the full directory path. Otherwise it wont work!!!!
